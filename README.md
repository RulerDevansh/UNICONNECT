## 🔐 Authentication & Security

### Registration with OTP Email Verification
- On sign-up, a **6-digit OTP** is generated via `crypto.randomInt` and emailed to the user (Gmail SMTP)
- OTP expires in **10 minutes**
- User must verify their email before they can log in
- Resend OTP available on the verification page
- Endpoints: `POST /api/auth/verify-email`, `POST /api/auth/resend-verification`

### Forgot / Reset Password (OTP-based)
- "Forgot password?" link on the Login page
- User enters registered email → 6-digit reset OTP is emailed
- Enter code + new password + confirm password to reset
- All active sessions (refresh tokens) are invalidated on reset
- Endpoints: `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`, `POST /api/auth/reset-password`

### General Security
- JWT access tokens (short-lived) + refresh tokens (rotation supported)
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (salt rounds: 10)
- Rate limiting on all routes (`express-rate-limit`)
- Helmet for HTTP security headers
- XSS sanitization middleware
- Strict CORS using `FRONTEND_URL` env variable
- Input validation with `express-validator`
